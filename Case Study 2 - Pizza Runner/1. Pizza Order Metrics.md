This is solution for case study2. (written by Yumin Kim)

#### 1. How many pizzas were ordered?

- Query :
    
    ```sql
    SELECT count(pizza_id) AS "total_order"
    FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders_temp;
    ```
    
- Results : 14 orders were made right now.
    
    
    | total_order |
    | --- |
    | 14 |

**2. How many unique customer orders were made?**

- Query :
    
    ```sql
    SELECT 
      COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS 'n_order'
    FROM customer_orders_temp;
    ```
    
- Results : 10 unique orders were made until now.
    
    
    | n_order |
    | --- |
    | 10 |

**3. How many times has each customer orderd/reorderd pizza?**

- Query :

```sql
-- distict time
SELECT customer_id, GROUP_CONCAT(distinct order_time)as order_date, 
        count(distinct order_time) as n_order
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders_temp
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

```sql
-- distinct day
SELECT customer_id, GROUP_CONCAT(distinct date_format(order_time, '%Y-%m-%d')) as order_date, 
        count(distinct(date_format(order_time, '%Y-%m-%d'))) as n_order
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders_temp
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

- Results : Almost every customer (except customer_id = ‚Äò105‚Äô) reorder pizza.

- Query :
    
    ```sql
    WITH Table1 AS (
    SELECT customer_id, max(order_time) as last_order, min(order_time) as first_order, count(distinct order_time) as n_order
    FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders_temp
    GROUP BY customer_id
    ORDER BY customer_id)
    
    SELECT customer_id, CONCAT(ROUND(DATEDIFF( last_order,first_order)/(n_order-1),2),'days') as cycle
    FROM Table1
    WHERE n_order <> 1;
    ```
    
- Results : 4.875days (average for all customers) takes to reorder.

    	count(c.*) AS n_pizza_type
    FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders_temp AS c
    	LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names AS p ON p.pizza_id = c.pizza_id
    	LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders_temp AS r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
    WHERE cancellation IS NULL
    GROUP BY p.pizza_name
    ORDER BY n_pizza_type DESC;
    ```

           SUM(CASE
                   WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN 1
                   ELSE 0
               END) AS 'meat_lovers',
           SUM(CASE
                   WHEN pizza_id = 2 THEN 1
                   ELSE 0
               END) AS 'vegetarian'
    FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders_temp
    GROUP BY customer_id

           dense_rank() over(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY count(*) desc) as ranking
    FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders_temp AS c
    	LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names AS p ON p.pizza_id = c.pizza_id
    GROUP BY customer_id, p.pizza_name)

**8. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?**

- Query :
    
    ```sql
    SELECT customer_id,
           order_id,
           count(order_id) AS pizza_count
    FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders_temp
    GROUP BY order_id
    ORDER BY pizza_count DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```
    
- Results :  The person,  who ordered the most , ordered 3 pizza at one time.

    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 103 | 4 | 3 |

**9. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?**

- Query :
    
    ```sql
    SELECT hour(order_time) AS 'Hour',
           count(order_id) AS 'n_order',
           round(100*count(order_id) /sum(count(order_id)) over(), 2) AS 'ratio'
    FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders_temp
    GROUP BY 1
    ORDER BY 1;
    ```
    
- Results : We can find the hourly pattern when consumer usually order pizza.
    
    
    | Hour | n_order | ratio |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 11 | 1 | 7.14 |
    | 13 | 3 | 21.43 |
    | 18 | 3 | 21.43 |
    | 19 | 1 | 7.14 |
    | 21 | 3 | 21.43 |
    | 23 | 3 | 21.43 |

**10. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?**

- The DAYOFWEEK() function returns the weekday index for a given date ( 1=Sunday, 2=Monday, 3=Tuesday, 4=Wednesday, 5=Thursday, 6=Friday, 7=Saturday )
- DAYNAME() returns the name of the week day
- Query :
    
    ```sql
    SELECT dayname(order_time) AS 'Day Of Week',
           count(order_id) AS 'n_order',
           round(100*count(order_id) /sum(count(order_id)) over(), 2) AS 'ratio'
    FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders_temp
    GROUP BY 1
    ORDER BY 2 DESC;
    ```
    
- Results : Also can find the weekly pattern when consumer usually order pizza.
    
    
    | Day of Week | n_order | ratio |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Wednesday | 5 | 35.71 |
    | Saturday | 5 | 21.4335.71 |
    | Thursday | 3 | 21.43 |
